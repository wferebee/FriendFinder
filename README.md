# FriendFinder 

 

 

### What is it? 

* The FriendFinder app allows the user to take a quick survey and be best matched with other users. 

* This app is Science themed, and although anyone can use it, the app comes preloaded with a few of our science friends from the past to be matched with. 

   

### How it works 

  * A server is set up with a specified port number and specific npm packages are shown to be required 

  * Front end files are used as a user interface - the home page and the survey page 

  * The back-end files are routing files that contain the logic to allow the app to take requests and send a response to the browser with the specified info. 

  * An algorithm is used to select a best match based on the user's survey responses. After this is done, a picture will pop up onto the screen and show the user who their new best friend is. 
  
  * Then user data will be stored and will be used to create best matches in the future.
